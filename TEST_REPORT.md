## 📋 Demo Script Recommendations

### 1. Document Upload Demo
1. Upload a text file or paste URL
2. Show real-time processing status
3. Demonstrate concept extraction

### 2. Batch Processing Demo
1. Upload multiple documents
2. Click "Extract All" button
3. Show parallel processing with progress

### 3. Error Handling Demo
1. Try invalid URL to show error handling
2. Demonstrate retry functionality
3. Show graceful degradation

### 4. Real-time Updates Demo
1. Open multiple browser tabs
2. Show live updates across sessions
3. Demonstrate Convex real-time sync

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking for demo)
- Missing network timeout configuration (uses browser defaults)
- URL validation could be more comprehensive
- No offline mode for degraded connectivity

### Enhancement Opportunities
- Add circuit breaker pattern for API failures
- Implement request/response logging for debugging
- Add more granular error categorization
- Consider adding caching for repeated documents

---

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

### Processing Limits
- **Max document size**: 8KB (truncated with notice)
- **API timeout**: Browser default (~30s)
- **Retry attempts**: 3 with exponential backoff
- **Batch processing**: Sequential with 2s delays

### Database Performance
- **Real-time queries**: Optimized with proper indexes
- **Relationship queries**: Efficient foreign key lookups
- **Document filtering**: Indexed by status and timestamp
