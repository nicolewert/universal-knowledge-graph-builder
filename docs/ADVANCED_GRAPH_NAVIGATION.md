# Advanced Graph Navigation Features

## Overview

The Universal Knowledge Graph Builder provides sophisticated navigation capabilities that enable users to explore complex knowledge networks with unprecedented ease and precision. Our advanced graph navigation features are designed to transform how users interact with interconnected information.

## 1. Search Functionality üîç

### Real-Time Concept Search
- **Instant Feedback**: Dynamically search through concepts with real-time highlighting
- **Debounced Performance**: 300ms delay prevents unnecessary processing
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard and screen reader friendly

#### Usage Example
```typescript
<GraphSearch 
  searchQuery={currentQuery}
  onSearchChange={handleSearchUpdate}
  placeholder="Search concepts..."
/>
```

#### Key Features
- Immediate visual feedback
- Smart input handling
- Customizable placeholder text

## 2. Comprehensive Filtering System üß©

### Category and Relationship Filtering
Our filtering system allows granular control over graph visualization through multiple dimensions:

#### Category Filters
- Dynamically fetch available categories from Convex database
- Multi-select category filtering
- Scrollable category list for large datasets

#### Relationship Type Filters
- Retrieve relationship types programmatically
- Enable/disable specific relationship visualizations
- Supports complex relationship exploration

#### Visual Controls
- **Node Size Slider**: Adjust node prominence (0.5x - 2x)
- **Edge Thickness Slider**: Control connection visibility (0.5x - 2x)

#### Usage Example
```typescript
<GraphFilters 
  filters={currentFilters}
  onFiltersChange={updateGraphFilters}
/>
```

## 3. Interactive Visualization Controls üñ•Ô∏è

### Navigation and Exploration
- **Zoom**: Seamless zooming for detailed exploration
- **Pan**: Smooth graph repositioning
- **Reset View**: Instantly return to default visualization

### Minimap Navigation
- Provide context for large, complex graphs
- Quick navigation across extensive knowledge networks

## 4. Keyboard Shortcuts üéπ

### Comprehensive Keyboard Navigation

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl/Cmd + F` | Focus Search Bar |
| `Arrow Keys` | Navigate Between Nodes |
| `+` / `-` | Zoom In/Out |
| `0` | Reset Zoom |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + R` | Reset Filters |

## 5. Technical Architecture üèóÔ∏è

### Component Structure
- **GraphSearch.tsx**: Real-time search implementation
- **GraphFilters.tsx**: Advanced filtering system
- **GraphVisualization.tsx**: Core rendering and interaction logic

### API Integration
- Seamless integration with Convex for dynamic data fetching
- Type-safe queries for categories and relationship types
- Reactive state management

## 6. Performance Considerations ‚ö°

- **Debounced Search**: Prevents unnecessary processing
- **Lazy Loading**: Efficient rendering of large graphs
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes

## 7. Extensibility

### Easy Customization
- Modular component design
- Configurable search and filter parameters
- Supports custom category and relationship type extensions

## Best Practices

1. Use filters to narrow complex graph views
2. Leverage keyboard shortcuts for faster navigation
3. Explore relationships across different categories
4. Utilize zoom and pan for detailed exploration

## Future Roadmap
- Machine learning-powered relationship suggestions
- Advanced visualization algorithms
- Enhanced accessibility features

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```
